# Configured Gulp Environment

A pre-configured Gulp environment designed to streamline web development tasks. With this environment, you can easily compile Sass, compress images, minify and obfuscate JavaScript for your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js: [Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Typically comes with the Node.js installation

## Installation

1. **Install the package from npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install configured-gulp-environment
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd configured-gulp-environment
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Use

After the installation, follow these steps:

1. **Edit Source Files:**

   Edit your source files located in the `source/` directory. You can modify Sass files, update images, and make changes to JavaScript files according to your project needs.

2. **Run Gulp Tasks:**

   Execute the relevant Gulp tasks based on your changes. For example:

   ```bash
   npm run compileSass
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run compressImages
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run minifyJS
   ```

   Or run all tasks together with:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Observe Changes:**

   If you want Gulp to automatically detect and process changes as you work, run:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

Now you're ready to develop with a configured Gulp environment!

## Project Structure

- `source/`: Contains the source files for Sass, images, and JavaScript.
- `dist/`: The output directory where compiled and minified files are generated.

## Additional Configuration

If you want to customize or extend the default settings, follow these steps:

Edit the Gulpfile:

Open the `gulpfile.js` file and modify it as needed. You can add new tasks or adjust specific settings.

Run Custom Tasks:

After the changes, run custom tasks using npm commands.
